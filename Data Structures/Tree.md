A Tree is a group of nodes that are connected through parent and child relations
A node has **only** one parent and can have multiple child nodes. This makes it kind of similar to a [[Linked Lists]]. 
*Degree of a Node* - the number of its child nodes
*Degree of a tree* - max degree of its nodes
*Depth of a node* - the number of its ancestors
