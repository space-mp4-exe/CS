Semantic analysis is the step in compilation where we look at what the code *means*. This goes further than syntactic analysis, which only looks at if some code is grammatically correct. The semantic analyzer binds variables to their values. We do this so we only have to resolve each variable only once per assignment and declaration. We'll know not just that an expression is a variable, but which variable it is.
