There are 4 different types of numbers that can appear in stats
- Nominal - about categories or classifications
- Ordinal - about order or rank (Tornado classifications)
- Interval - represents *distance* between consecutive numbers have meaning (temperature, fahrenheit)
	- 120 fahrenheit is *not* "twice as hot" as 60 fahrenheit
- Ratio - same as Interval, but where ratios of these numbers also have meaning
